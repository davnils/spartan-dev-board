Xilinx Spartan-3A(N) 50k development board
==========================================

This is a simple breakout board for the Spartan-3A(N) FPGA, with power supply and support for configuration included.
The board has been produced and tested with a XC3S50AN FPGA. It's preferred to use the Spartan-3AN series since they have internal flash.

Schematics and board layout are in the Eagle CAD format.
